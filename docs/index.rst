Jarvis Enhanced System Integration Documentation
==============================================

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Jarvis Enhanced System Integration & Source Code Consciousness features. This documentation covers the advanced capabilities that transform Jarvis into a self-aware, orchestrated system with deep understanding of its own implementation.

Overview
--------

The Enhanced System Integration project adds four major capabilities to Jarvis:

1. **Enhanced Plugin Registry** - Intelligent metadata and relationship tracking for all tools and plugins
2. **Context Management System** - Shared context and conversation state management across interactions
3. **Smart Tool Orchestration** - Intelligent tool chaining and coordination for complex tasks
4. **Source Code Consciousness** - Deep understanding of system implementation through codebase RAG

Key Features
-----------

🔧 **Enhanced Plugin Registry**
   - Automatic capability detection and analysis
   - Tool relationship mapping and dependency tracking
   - Usage analytics and performance monitoring
   - Intelligent plugin recommendations

🧠 **Context Management**
   - Persistent conversation state across sessions
   - User preference learning and adaptation
   - Tool state tracking and coordination
   - Session-specific memory management

🎭 **Smart Orchestration**
   - Automatic tool chain detection and optimization
   - Context-aware tool selection
   - Conflict resolution and dependency management
   - Machine learning-based improvement over time

💻 **Code Consciousness**
   - Semantic indexing of the entire codebase
   - Natural language code queries and navigation
   - Dependency graph analysis and visualization
   - Safe self-modification suggestions

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Prophet60191/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis

   # Set up enhanced development environment
   python scripts/setup_enhanced_dev_env.py

   # Install enhanced dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-enhanced.txt

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   from jarvis.core.orchestration import SystemOrchestrator
   from jarvis.core.context import ContextManager
   from jarvis.plugins.registry import UnifiedPluginRegistry

   # Initialize enhanced components
   orchestrator = SystemOrchestrator()
   context_manager = ContextManager()
   registry = UnifiedPluginRegistry()

   # Use enhanced features
   context = context_manager.get_current_context()
   plan = orchestrator.orchestrate_request("analyze my files", context)
   result = orchestrator.execute_plan(plan)

Architecture Overview
--------------------

The enhanced system follows a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly with the existing Jarvis codebase:

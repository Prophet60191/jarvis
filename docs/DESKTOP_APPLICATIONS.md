# Desktop Applications Guide

This guide covers Jarvis's native desktop applications, including the Knowledge Vault and Settings Panel, along with their robust lifecycle management system.

## Overview

Jarvis includes two native desktop applications built with PyWebView:

1. **Knowledge Vault** (`rag_app.py`) - Document management and RAG system control
2. **Settings Panel** (`jarvis_settings_app.py`) - Jarvis configuration and preferences

Both applications feature:
- Native desktop windows with web-based UI
- Voice command integration
- Robust lifecycle management
- Proper signal handling and cleanup
- Reliable open/close cycles

## Voice Commands

### Opening Applications

| Command | Action | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| "Open vault" | Opens the Knowledge Vault | `rag_app.py` |
| "Open settings" | Opens the Settings Panel | `jarvis_settings_app.py` |
| "Show vault" | Opens the Knowledge Vault | `rag_app.py` |
| "Manage vault" | Opens the Knowledge Vault | `rag_app.py` |
| "Open documents" | Opens the Knowledge Vault | `rag_app.py` |

### Closing Applications

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Close vault" | Closes the Knowledge Vault |
| "Close settings" | Closes the Settings Panel |

### Panel-Specific Opening

You can open specific panels within applications:

```
"Open vault upload"     â†’ Opens vault with upload panel
"Open vault documents"  â†’ Opens vault with documents panel
"Open vault memory"     â†’ Opens vault with memory panel
"Open settings audio"   â†’ Opens settings with audio panel
"Open settings llm"     â†’ Opens settings with LLM panel
```

## Application Architecture

### Robust Lifecycle Management

The desktop applications use a sophisticated lifecycle management system that ensures reliable operation:

#### Signal Handling
```python
def signal_handler(signum, frame):
    print(f"\nðŸ›‘ App received signal {signum}, shutting down...")
    shutdown_event.set()
    try:
        webview.destroy()  # Clean up webview resources
    except:
        pass
    sys.exit(0)  # Clean exit

signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
```

#### Process Group Management
- Applications start in new process groups (`start_new_session=True`)
- Graceful termination with SIGTERM to entire process group
- Force kill fallback with SIGKILL if graceful termination fails
- Cleanup of related background processes

#### Application Manager
The `AppManager` class provides:
- Application registration and tracking
- Automatic cleanup of existing instances before starting new ones
- Thread-safe operations with locks
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### File Locations

```
jarvis/
â”œâ”€â”€ rag_app.py                           # Knowledge Vault application
â”œâ”€â”€ jarvis/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ jarvis_settings_app.py           # Settings Panel application
â””â”€â”€ jarvis/jarvis/utils/
    â””â”€â”€ app_manager.py                   # Application lifecycle manager
```

### Tool Integration

Desktop applications are controlled through plugin tools:

- **Vault Tools**: `jarvis/jarvis/tools/plugins/rag_ui_tool.py`
  - `open_rag_manager()` - Opens the vault
  - `close_rag_manager()` - Closes the vault

- **Settings Tools**: `jarvis/jarvis/tools/plugins/jarvis_ui_tool.py`
  - `open_jarvis_ui()` - Opens settings
  - `close_jarvis_ui()` - Closes settings

## Knowledge Vault Application

### Features
- Document upload and management
- RAG system configuration
- Memory management interface
- Database agent monitoring
- Document versioning and history

### Panels
- **Main**: Dashboard overview
- **Upload**: Document upload interface
- **Documents**: Document library management
- **Memory**: Memory and knowledge management
- **Settings**: RAG configuration options

### Usage
```bash
# Direct launch
python rag_app.py --panel main

# Voice command
"Open vault"
"Open vault upload"
```

## Settings Panel Application

### Features
- Audio configuration (microphone, speakers, TTS)
- LLM model configuration
- Conversation settings
- Logging configuration
- Voice profile management
- Device information

### Panels
- **Main**: Settings dashboard
- **Audio**: Audio device and TTS configuration
- **LLM**: Language model settings
- **Conversation**: Chat and response settings
- **Logging**: Debug and logging options
- **General**: General application settings
- **Voice Profiles**: Voice cloning and profiles
- **Device**: System and device information

### Usage
```bash
# Direct launch
python jarvis/jarvis_settings_app.py --panel audio

# Voice command
"Open settings"
"Open settings audio"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Open
1. Check if PyWebView is installed: `pip install pywebview`
2. Verify application files exist at correct paths
3. Check for port conflicts (default: 8080 for settings, 8081 for vault)

#### Application Won't Close
1. The new signal handling should resolve this automatically
2. If issues persist, check for zombie processes: `ps aux | grep jarvis`
3. Force kill if necessary: `pkill -f "rag_app.py"`

#### Path Resolution Issues
The robust path finding algorithm automatically locates applications:
- Searches up directory tree for project root (contains `rag_app.py`)
- Constructs absolute paths to application files
- Provides fallback to current working directory

### Debugging

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
```bash
# Environment variable
export JARVIS_DEBUG=true

# Direct launch with debug
python rag_app.py --debug
python jarvis/jarvis_settings_app.py --debug
```

### Log Locations
- Application logs: `~/.jarvis/logs/`
- Process management logs: Check Jarvis main log output

## Development

### Adding New Desktop Applications

1. **Create Application Script**
   ```python
   # my_app.py
   import signal
   import webview
   
   def signal_handler(signum, frame):
       webview.destroy()
       sys.exit(0)
   
   signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)
   signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
   
   webview.create_window("My App", "http://localhost:8082")
   webview.start()
   ```

2. **Register with App Manager**
   ```python
   from jarvis.utils.app_manager import get_app_manager
   
   app_manager = get_app_manager()
   app_manager.register_app("my_app", "/path/to/my_app.py")
   ```

3. **Create Tool Plugin**
   ```python
   @tool
   def open_my_app() -> str:
       app_manager = get_app_manager()
       if app_manager.start_app("my_app"):
           return "My App is now open."
       return "Failed to open My App."
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Always implement signal handlers** for graceful shutdown
2. **Use the AppManager** for lifecycle management
3. **Start in new process groups** to avoid conflicts
4. **Clean up webview resources** before exit
5. **Provide fallback mechanisms** for error cases
6. **Use absolute paths** for reliable file location

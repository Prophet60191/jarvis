# MCP Memory Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) memory data to the new RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system while ensuring data continuity and user experience.

## Current State Analysis

### MCP Memory System
- **Location**: MCP tools handle memory through external protocols
- **Data Format**: Structured memory entries with metadata
- **Storage**: External MCP server storage (varies by implementation)
- **Access Pattern**: Tool-based retrieval through MCP protocol

### New RAG System
- **Location**: `data/vector_store/` (ChromaDB)
- **Data Format**: Vector embeddings with metadata
- **Storage**: Local ChromaDB database
- **Access Pattern**: Semantic search with intelligent synthesis

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Discovery and Export (Week 1)

#### 1.1 MCP Memory Inventory
```bash
# Create inventory script
./scripts/mcp_memory_inventory.py
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Identify all MCP memory sources currently in use
- [ ] Catalog memory entry types and formats
- [ ] Estimate total memory volume and complexity
- [ ] Document current MCP tool dependencies

#### 1.2 Export Mechanism
```python
# Example export structure
{
    "source": "mcp_memory",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "entries": [
        {
            "id": "mem_001",
            "content": "User prefers Python for AI projects",
            "metadata": {
                "type": "preference",
                "confidence": 0.9,
                "created": "2024-01-10T15:20:00Z"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Transformation (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Content Mapping
- **Personal Facts** → RAG conversational memory
- **Preferences** → RAG conversational memory with preference tags
- **Project Context** → RAG document ingestion (if structured)
- **Conversation History** → Chat session persistence

#### 2.2 Metadata Preservation
```python
# Migration metadata structure
migration_metadata = {
    "original_source": "mcp_memory",
    "migration_date": timestamp,
    "original_id": mcp_entry_id,
    "confidence_score": original_confidence,
    "entry_type": "preference|fact|context"
}
```

### Phase 3: Migration Implementation (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Migration Script
```python
# ./scripts/migrate_mcp_to_rag.py
class MCPToRAGMigrator:
    def __init__(self, rag_service, mcp_export_path):
        self.rag_service = rag_service
        self.mcp_data = self.load_mcp_export(mcp_export_path)
    
    def migrate_memories(self):
        """Migrate MCP memories to RAG system."""
        for entry in self.mcp_data['entries']:
            self.migrate_single_entry(entry)
    
    def migrate_single_entry(self, entry):
        """Migrate individual memory entry."""
        # Transform content for RAG
        rag_content = self.transform_content(entry)
        
        # Add to RAG with migration metadata
        self.rag_service.add_conversational_memory(
            fact=rag_content,
            metadata=self.create_migration_metadata(entry)
        )
```

#### 3.2 Validation and Testing
- [ ] Create test dataset with known MCP entries
- [ ] Verify migration accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Test retrieval quality post-migration
- [ ] Validate metadata preservation

### Phase 4: Transition Management (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Dual System Operation
```python
# Hybrid retrieval during transition
class HybridMemoryRetriever:
    def __init__(self, rag_service, mcp_client):
        self.rag_service = rag_service
        self.mcp_client = mcp_client
        self.migration_complete = False
    
    async def search_memory(self, query):
        # Search RAG first
        rag_results = await self.rag_service.intelligent_search(query)
        
        # Fallback to MCP if needed
        if not self.migration_complete and not rag_results['retrieved_documents']:
            mcp_results = await self.mcp_client.search_memory(query)
            return self.merge_results(rag_results, mcp_results)
        
        return rag_results
```

#### 4.2 User Communication
- [ ] Notify users about migration process
- [ ] Provide migration status updates
- [ ] Offer rollback option during transition period
- [ ] Document any behavioral changes

## Technical Implementation

### Migration Tools

#### 1. MCP Export Tool
```python
# ./tools/mcp_exporter.py
def export_mcp_memories(output_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Export all MCP memories to JSON format."""
    # Implementation depends on specific MCP setup
    pass
```

#### 2. RAG Import Tool
```python
# ./tools/rag_importer.py
def import_mcp_memories(export_file: str, rag_service: RAGService) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Import MCP memories into RAG system."""
    pass
```

#### 3. Migration Validator
```python
# ./tools/migration_validator.py
def validate_migration(original_export: str, rag_service: RAGService) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate migration completeness and accuracy."""
    pass
```

### Data Backup Strategy

#### Pre-Migration Backup
```bash
# Create comprehensive backup before migration
./scripts/create_pre_migration_backup.sh
```

#### Rollback Plan
```python
# Rollback mechanism if migration fails
class MigrationRollback:
    def __init__(self, backup_path: str):
        self.backup_path = backup_path
    
    def rollback_to_mcp(self):
        """Restore MCP system and disable RAG."""
        # Restore MCP data
        # Disable RAG system
        # Update configuration
        pass
```

## Quality Assurance

### Migration Testing

#### 1. Content Preservation Test
- [ ] Verify all MCP entries are migrated
- [ ] Check content integrity and formatting
- [ ] Validate metadata preservation

#### 2. Retrieval Quality Test
- [ ] Compare search results before/after migration
- [ ] Test edge cases and complex queries
- [ ] Measure retrieval accuracy and relevance

#### 3. Performance Test

- [ ] Monitor memory usage and system resources
- [ ] Test concurrent access patterns

### Success Metrics

#### Quantitative Metrics
- **Migration Completeness**: 100% of MCP entries migrated
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: ≥95% of queries return relevant results
- **Performance**: Search latency ≤2 seconds
- **Data Integrity**: 0% data corruption or loss

# Open Interpreter Integration with Jarvis Voice Assistant

## üéØ Overview

This integration adds powerful local code execution capabilities to Jarvis using Open Interpreter, enabling your voice assistant to:

- **Execute code locally** in Python, JavaScript, Shell, and more
- **Analyze data** and create visualizations
- **Manipulate files** and automate system tasks
- **Create scripts** and tools on demand
- **Process documents** and extract information
- **Perform calculations** and data analysis

**üîí Privacy First**: Everything runs locally on your machine - no cloud services, no data sharing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Local-Only Execution

```

### Integration Points
- **LLM**: Uses your existing Ollama llama3.1:8b model
- **Execution**: All code runs on your local machine
- **Safety**: Asks permission before running potentially dangerous code
- **Memory**: Maintains session context for follow-up commands

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
python setup_open_interpreter.py
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check that Ollama is running with llama3.1:8b
- ‚úÖ Install Open Interpreter and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Configure for local-only operation
- ‚úÖ Test the integration
- ‚úÖ Create usage examples

### 2. Manual Installation (Alternative)
```bash
# Install Open Interpreter
pip install open-interpreter

# Install optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
pip install matplotlib pandas requests beautifulsoup4 pillow

# Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Ensure you have the required model
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### 3. Restart Jarvis
After installation, restart Jarvis to load the new plugin:
```bash
python start_jarvis.py
```

## üîí Security & Safety Features

### Local Execution Only
- **No Cloud**: All processing happens on your machine
- **No API Calls**: Uses your local Ollama instance
- **No Data Sharing**: Nothing leaves your computer

### Permission System
- **Safe Mode**: Asks before running potentially dangerous code
- **Code Review**: Shows you the code before execution
- **User Control**: You approve or deny each execution

### Sandboxing
- **Isolated Environment**: Code runs in controlled context
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents runaway processes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Default Settings
```python
# Open Interpreter Configuration
offline = True                    # No internet required
auto_run = False                 # Ask permission before running code
safe_mode = "ask"               # Safety checks enabled
model = "ollama/llama3.1:8b"    # Use your local model
api_base = "http://localhost:11434"  # Local Ollama server
```

### Customization
You can modify settings in `jarvis/tools/plugins/open_interpreter_tool.py`:

```python
# In get_interpreter() function
_interpreter_instance.auto_run = True  # Auto-run trusted code
_interpreter_instance.safe_mode = "off"  # Disable safety (not recommended)
```

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Basic Test
```
You: "What is 2 + 2? Calculate it with code."
Jarvis: [Shows Python code] "print(2 + 2)"
Jarvis: "The result is 4."
```

### File Analysis Test
```
You: "Analyze the data in my sales.csv file"
Jarvis: [Executes pandas code to analyze the CSV]
Jarvis: "I found 1,250 sales records. The average sale amount is $156.78..."
```

### Script Creation Test
```
You: "Create a Python script to organize my downloads folder"
Jarvis: [Generates and shows Python script]
Jarvis: "I've created a script that organizes files by type. Should I run it?"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Open Interpreter not available"
**Solution**: Run the setup script or install manually:
```bash
pip install open-interpreter
```

#### 2. "Connection to Ollama failed"
**Solution**: Ensure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama serve
```

#### 3. "Model not found"
**Solution**: Install the required model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

#### 4. "Permission denied" errors
**Solution**: Check file permissions and run with appropriate privileges

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in Jarvis to see detailed execution information:
```python
# In jarvis config
logging.level = "DEBUG"
```

### Log Files
Check these locations for error information:
- Jarvis logs: `jarvis_debug.log`
- Open Interpreter logs: `~/.config/open-interpreter/logs/`

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Session Persistence
Open Interpreter maintains context across commands:
```
You: "Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10"
Jarvis: [Creates the list]
You: "Now calculate the sum of that list"
Jarvis: [Uses the previously created list]
```

### Multi-step Tasks
```
You: "Download this dataset, clean it, and create a visualization"
Jarvis: [Executes multiple code blocks in sequence]
```

### Integration with Jarvis RAG
Combine with Jarvis's memory system:
```
You: "Remember that I prefer matplotlib for charts"
[Later]
You: "Create a chart from this data"
Jarvis: [Uses matplotlib based on your preference]
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Code execution uses local CPU resources
- **Memory**: Large datasets may require significant RAM
- **Storage**: Generated files and logs consume disk space

### Optimization Tips
- Use efficient algorithms for large datasets
- Clean up temporary files regularly
- Monitor system resources during heavy tasks

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Code Templates**: Pre-built scripts for common tasks
- **Result Caching**: Cache results for repeated operations
- **Enhanced Safety**: More sophisticated code analysis
- **GUI Integration**: Visual code editor and results viewer

### Community Contributions
- Submit plugin improvements via GitHub
- Share useful code templates and examples
- Report bugs and suggest features

## üìù Notes and Observations

### **Key Insights from Research**
- **Graph-based workflows** most effective for complex, non-linear tasks
- **Role-based specialization** critical for clear agent responsibilities  
- **Performance tracking and learning** essential for continuous improvement
- **Incremental implementation** reduces risk while preserving working systems

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Preserve wake word detection**: No changes to working audio system
- **Build on smart routing**: Enhance existing routing logic
- **Modular orchestration**: Separate orchestration from agent implementation
- **Learning capability**: System improves with usage patterns

### **üö® CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS**
- **NEVER modify wake word detection**: `start_jarvis_fixed.py` is sacred code
- **NEVER break tool access**: All 34 tools must remain accessible
- **ADDITIVE changes only**: Build on top, don't modify existing functionality
- **Immediate fallback**: Every change has instant rollback capability
- **Test after every change**: Wake word + tools must work 100%

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Incremental approach**: Each phase builds on previous success
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Preserve existing functionality if orchestration fails
- **Performance monitoring**: Track metrics to ensure no degradation
- **User feedback**: Continuous validation of improvements

## üéØ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

### **üß† Intelligent Orchestration Capabilities**

#### **Before Enhancement**
- Basic tool selection without workflow planning
- Generic responses: "I can help with that. What would you like to know?"
- No coordination between tools
- Limited error handling

#### **After Enhancement**
- **Website Extraction**: "I'll handle this website data extraction for you. Here's my plan:
  1. First, I'll use LaVague to explore the site structure and identify data patterns
  2. Then, I'll coordinate with Aider to create a custom scraper based on the analysis  
  3. Finally, I'll use Open Interpreter to execute the scraper and process the data
  Let me start by analyzing the website structure..."

- **Code Development**: "I'll build a comprehensive monitoring system for you. Here's my plan:
  1. First, I'll check my knowledge base for existing monitoring patterns
  2. Then, I'll use Aider to create the monitoring script with alerting capabilities
  3. Next, I'll test the script with Open Interpreter to validate functionality
  4. Finally, I'll create automated tests to ensure reliability
  Let me start by checking for existing monitoring patterns..."

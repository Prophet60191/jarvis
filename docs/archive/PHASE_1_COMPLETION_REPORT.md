## 🎯 Expected User Experience Improvements

### **Website Extraction Example**
**Before**: "I can help with that. What would you like to know?"  
**After**: "I'll handle this website data extraction for you. Here's my plan:
1. First, I'll use LaVague to explore the site structure and identify data patterns
2. Then, I'll coordinate with Aider to create a custom scraper based on the analysis
3. Finally, I'll use Open Interpreter to execute the scraper and process the data
Let me start by analyzing the website structure..."

### **Code Development Example**
**Before**: Generic coding assistance without systematic approach  
**After**: "I'll build a comprehensive monitoring system for you. Here's my plan:
1. First, I'll check my knowledge base for existing monitoring patterns
2. Then, I'll use Aider to create the monitoring script with alerting capabilities
3. Next, I'll test the script with Open Interpreter to validate functionality
4. Finally, I'll create automated tests to ensure reliability
Let me start by checking for existing monitoring patterns..."

# 🎯 The Complete Jarvis Prompt Engineering Guide

**Master the art of communicating with Jarvis to unlock its full orchestration potential**

*Based on industry-leading prompt engineering best practices and optimized for Jarvis's enhanced orchestration system*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: The Golden Rules

### **1. Be Explicit About What You Want**
- ❌ **Vague**: "Help me with my files"
- ✅ **Clear**: "Create a tool to organize my Downloads folder by file type"

### **2. Use Action Words for Tool Creation**
- ❌ **Advice-seeking**: "How do I monitor disk usage?"
- ✅ **Tool-creation**: "Build a script to monitor my disk usage and alert me when it's full"

### **3. Specify the Complexity Level**
- 🟢 **Simple**: Direct questions, single tool usage
- 🟡 **Medium**: Tool creation, data processing, automation
- 🔴 **Complex**: Multi-step workflows, dashboards, comprehensive systems

## 📚 The Jarvis Prompt Framework

### **🎭 1. Role Prompting (Set the Context)**

Tell Jarvis what role it should take:

```
✅ EXCELLENT EXAMPLES:
"Act as a Python developer and create a web scraper..."
"As a system administrator, build a monitoring tool..."
"Working as a data analyst, develop a dashboard..."
```

### **🎯 2. Task Specification (Be Crystal Clear)**

Use specific action verbs that trigger orchestration:

#### **Tool Creation Keywords:**
- **"Create a tool/script/system"**
- **"Build a program/application"** 
- **"Develop a solution/dashboard"**
- **"Make a utility/monitor"**
- **"Generate a workflow/automation"**

#### **Multi-Agent Keywords:**
- **"Extract data and analyze"** (LaVague + Analysis)
- **"Build and test thoroughly"** (Aider + Open Interpreter + Robot Framework)
- **"Research and create a report"** (RAG + Analysis + Documentation)

### **🔧 3. Technical Specifications**

Be specific about requirements:

```
✅ GOOD SPECIFICATIONS:
- "Monitor CPU usage every 5 minutes"
- "Send email alerts when disk usage exceeds 80%"
- "Organize photos by YYYY/MM/DD folder structure"
- "Create a dashboard with real-time updates"
- "Generate weekly reports in PDF format"
```

### **📊 4. Expected Output Format**

Tell Jarvis exactly what you want:

```
✅ CLEAR OUTPUT REQUESTS:
- "Create a Python script that I can run from command line"
- "Build a web dashboard accessible at localhost:8080"
- "Generate a report as a PDF file"
- "Make a tool with a simple GUI interface"
```

## 🎨 Prompt Templates by Use Case

### **🛠️ Tool Creation Template**

```
[ROLE] + [ACTION] + [SPECIFIC TASK] + [REQUIREMENTS] + [OUTPUT FORMAT]

Example:
"As a system administrator, create a tool to monitor my server's 
disk usage, CPU load, and memory consumption. The tool should 
check every 10 minutes and send email alerts when any metric 
exceeds 80%. Create this as a Python script I can run as a 
background service."
```

### **🌐 Web Scraping Template**

```
"Build a web scraper to extract [SPECIFIC DATA] from [WEBSITE]. 
The scraper should [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS] and save the data 
as [FORMAT]. Include error handling and rate limiting."

Example:
"Build a web scraper to extract product prices from Amazon 
search results. The scraper should handle pagination, avoid 
getting blocked, and save data as CSV with columns: name, 
price, rating, availability."
```

### **📊 Dashboard Template**

```
"Create a personal dashboard that displays [DATA SOURCES] 
with [SPECIFIC FEATURES]. The dashboard should [REQUIREMENTS] 
and be accessible via [ACCESS METHOD]."

Example:
"Create a personal dashboard that displays my calendar events, 
local weather, latest news headlines, and cryptocurrency prices. 
The dashboard should auto-refresh every 15 minutes and be 
accessible via web browser at localhost:3000."
```

### **🤖 Automation Template**

```
"Develop an automation system to [SPECIFIC TASK] that runs 
[FREQUENCY] and [SPECIFIC ACTIONS]. Include [SAFETY FEATURES] 
and [NOTIFICATION METHODS]."

Example:
"Develop an automation system to backup my important documents 
to Google Drive that runs daily at 2 AM and creates incremental 
backups. Include duplicate detection and email notifications 
of backup status."
```

---

## 🎯 Complexity-Based Prompting

### **🟢 Simple Prompts (Direct Knowledge/Single Tool)**

```
✅ EXAMPLES:
- "What time is it?"
- "Remember that I prefer Python for data analysis"
- "Search my documents for machine learning notes"
- "What's the weather like today?"
```

**Expected Response**: Direct answer or single tool usage

### **🟡 Medium Prompts (Tool Creation/Multi-Step)**

```
✅ EXAMPLES:
- "Create a script to organize my photos by date"
- "Build a tool to track my daily expenses"
- "Develop a system to monitor website uptime"
- "Make a utility to convert files between formats"
```

**Expected Response**: "Here's my plan: 1. I'll use Aider to... 2. Then Open Interpreter to..."

### **🔴 Complex Prompts (Multi-Agent Orchestration)**

```
✅ EXAMPLES:
- "Extract data from competitor websites, analyze pricing trends, and create an interactive dashboard"
- "Build a comprehensive backup system, test it thoroughly, and create automated scheduling with monitoring"
- "Research the latest AI developments, create a summary report, and build a tool to track ongoing updates"
```

**Expected Response**: Full orchestration with 3+ agents and detailed workflow

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **❌ Mistake 1: Being Too Vague**
```
BAD: "Help me with my computer"
GOOD: "Create a tool to monitor my computer's performance and alert me about issues"
```

### **❌ Mistake 2: Asking for Advice Instead of Action**
```
BAD: "How do I organize my files?"
GOOD: "Build a script to automatically organize my Downloads folder by file type"
```

### **❌ Mistake 3: No Specifications**
```
BAD: "Make a website"
GOOD: "Create a personal portfolio website with sections for projects, skills, and contact info, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript"
```

### **❌ Mistake 4: Unclear Output Expectations**
```
BAD: "Create something to track expenses"
GOOD: "Build a expense tracking tool with a simple GUI that saves data to CSV and shows monthly summaries"
```

## 🎪 Advanced Prompting Techniques

### **🔗 Chain of Thought Prompting**

For complex reasoning tasks:

```
"Build a stock analysis tool. Break this down step by step:
1. First, identify what data sources we need
2. Then, determine the analysis methods
3. Next, design the user interface
4. Finally, implement the alert system
Create a comprehensive solution following this approach."
```

### **🎭 Persona-Based Prompting**

```
"You are an experienced DevOps engineer. Create a monitoring 
solution for a small startup that needs to track server health, 
application performance, and user activity. Design this with 
cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance in mind."
```

### **📝 Few-Shot Prompting**

Provide examples of what you want:

```
"Create automation scripts following these patterns:

Example 1: File organizer - monitors Downloads, sorts by extension
Example 2: Backup tool - daily sync to cloud, email confirmation
Example 3: System monitor - checks resources, logs alerts

Now create: A photo organizer that sorts by date and location"
```

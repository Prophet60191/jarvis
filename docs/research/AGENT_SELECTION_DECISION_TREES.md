## 🔄 Dynamic Decision Making

### **Adaptive Agent Selection**

```python
# Pseudo-code for dynamic agent selection
def select_optimal_agent(request, context, user_history):
    # Analyze request complexity
    complexity = assess_complexity(request)
    
    # Identify required capabilities
    capabilities = identify_capabilities(request)
    
    # Consider user context and history
    user_preferences = get_user_preferences(user_history)
    
    # Select primary agent
    primary_agent = select_primary_agent(capabilities, user_preferences)
    
    # Plan supporting agents
    supporting_agents = plan_supporting_agents(complexity, capabilities)
    
    # Create workflow
    workflow = create_workflow(primary_agent, supporting_agents, complexity)
    
    return workflow
```

### **Fallback Decision Tree**

```
PRIMARY AGENT FAILS
├── Identify Failure Type
│   ├── Tool Unavailable → Select Alternative Tool
│   ├── Execution Error → Retry with Different Parameters
│   ├── Capability Mismatch → Select Different Agent
│   └── Resource Limitation → Simplify Approach
├── Alternative Agent Selection
│   ├── Aider fails → Try Open Interpreter for coding
│   ├── LaVague fails → Try Open Interpreter for web tasks
│   ├── Open Interpreter fails → Try simpler approach
│   └── RAG fails → Use direct knowledge
├── Graceful Degradation
│   ├── Provide partial results
│   ├── Explain limitations clearly
│   ├── Suggest alternative approaches
│   └── Offer manual guidance
└── User Communication
    ├── Transparent about what failed
    ├── Clear about what's still possible

## 📊 Decision Metrics

### **Agent Selection Criteria**

1. **Capability Match**: How well does the agent's capabilities match the task requirements?
2. **Efficiency**: Which agent can complete the task most efficiently?
3. **Reliability**: Which agent has the highest success rate for this type of task?
4. **User Preference**: Does the user have preferences based on past interactions?
5. **Context Appropriateness**: Is the agent suitable for the current context?

### **Workflow Optimization Factors**

1. **Parallel Execution**: Can tasks be done simultaneously to save time?
2. **Dependency Management**: Are there dependencies that require sequential execution?
3. **Resource Utilization**: How can we optimize resource usage across agents?
4. **Error Recovery**: What fallback options are available if agents fail?
5. **User Experience**: How can we provide the best user experience?

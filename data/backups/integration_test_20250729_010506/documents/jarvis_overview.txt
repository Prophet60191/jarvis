Jarvis Voice Assistant - System Overview

Jarvis is an advanced AI-powered voice assistant built with a plugin-based architecture and RAG memory system.

Key Features:
- Voice interaction with wake word detection
- Dual memory system (short-term chat + long-term persistent facts)
- Plugin-based tool system with zero built-in tools
- ChromaDB vector database for semantic search
- Web-based control panel for configuration
- MCP integration for external services

Architecture:
The system follows a clean separation between core conversation management and extensible functionality through plugins. The RAG memory system uses ChromaDB to store both conversational facts and document content with semantic search capabilities.

Memory System:
- Short-term memory: Current conversation context
- Long-term memory: Explicitly stored facts and document knowledge
- Semantic search: Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- PII protection: Automatic detection and warnings

Voice Capabilities:
- Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper
- Text-to-speech with multiple engine support
- Voice cloning for personalized responses
- Wake word detection for hands-free operation

Development:
Built with Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, and modern web technologies. The plugin system allows developers to add functionality without modifying core code.

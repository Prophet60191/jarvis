# RAG Data Protection

This directory contains user data, vector stores, and documents that are automatically excluded from Git commits for privacy and security.

## Protected Directories

- `data/chroma_db/` - Vector database storage
- `data/documents/` - User uploaded documents  
- `data/backups/` - System backups
- `data/chat_history/` - Conversation history

## Security Measures

1. **Git Exclusion**: All data directories are in .gitignore
2. **Local Storage**: Data stays on your local machine
3. **Privacy Protection**: No user data is committed to version control

## Backup Recommendations

- Regularly backup the `data/` directory
- Use the built-in RAG backup tools
- Store backups securely and privately

## Important Notes

- Never commit user data to version control
- Be cautious when sharing project files
- Regularly review .gitignore for completeness

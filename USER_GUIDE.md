## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is Jarvis?

Jarvis is a sophisticated AI voice assistant built on **True Separation of Concerns** architecture. Unlike monolithic assistants, Jarvis:

- **Keeps your data private** - Everything stays on your computer
- **Works offline** - No internet required for core functionality
- **Is truly modular** - Core system, plugins, UIs, and integrations are completely independent
- **Allows safe customization** - Add functionality without breaking existing features
- **Enables independent development** - Modify any component without affecting others
- **Provides fault isolation** - Component failures don't cascade to other parts
- **Remembers information** - Persistent memory across sessions
- **Learns your preferences** - Personalized responses

### First Time Setup

1. **Installation**: Follow the [Installation Guide](jarvis/docs/installation.md)
2. **Start Jarvis**: Run `python start_jarvis.py`
3. **Test your microphone**: Say "Hey Jarvis" and wait for acknowledgment
4. **Set your name**: Say "My name is [Your Name]"
5. **Test basic commands**: Try "What time is it?"

### Understanding the Interface

Jarvis has multiple interfaces:

- **Voice Interface**: Primary interaction method
- **Web Interface**: Configuration and management (http://localhost:8080)
- **Desktop Apps**: Knowledge vault and settings panels
- **Command Line**: For advanced users and debugging

## üé§ Basic Voice Commands

### Wake Word

**Default**: "Hey Jarvis" or "Jarvis"

Say the wake word and wait for the acknowledgment sound before giving your command.

### Essential Commands

#### **Time & Information**
```
"What time is it?"
"What's the date today?"
"What day is it?"
```

#### **System Control**
```
"Open settings"          ‚Üí Opens configuration panel
"Close settings"         ‚Üí Closes configuration panel
"Open vault"            ‚Üí Opens knowledge management
"Close vault"           ‚Üí Closes knowledge management
"Stop listening"        ‚Üí Pauses voice recognition
"Start listening"       ‚Üí Resumes voice recognition
```

"What do you remember about me?" ‚Üí Shows stored memories
```

### Command Tips

- **Speak clearly** and at normal pace
- **Wait for acknowledgment** after the wake word
- **Use natural language** - Jarvis understands conversational speech
- **Be specific** when possible for better results

## üß† Memory System

Jarvis has a sophisticated dual memory system that helps it remember information across conversations.

### How Memory Works

**Short-Term Memory**:
- Remembers context within the current conversation
- Includes recent exchanges and references
- Clears when you restart Jarvis

**Long-Term Memory**:
- Permanently stores facts you explicitly ask it to remember
- Survives across sessions and restarts
- Uses semantic search to find relevant information

### Storing Information

Use natural "remember" commands:

```
"Remember that I like iced coffee over hot coffee"
"Remember my birthday is March 15th"
"Remember that I work from home on Fridays"
"Remember my favorite pizza place is Tony's on Main Street"
"Remember I'm allergic to shellfish"
"Store this fact: I prefer morning workouts"
```

### Retrieving Information

Ask Jarvis to recall stored information:

```
"What do you remember about my coffee preferences?"
"Do you remember my birthday?"
"What have I told you about my work schedule?"
"Tell me what you know about my food allergies"
"What do you remember about my favorite restaurants?"
"Do you remember anything about my exercise routine?"
```

### Memory Management

```
"What do you remember about me?"     ‚Üí Shows all stored information
"Forget everything about coffee"     ‚Üí Removes specific memories
"Clear all my memories"              ‚Üí Removes all stored information
```

### Privacy & Data

- **All data stays local** - Never transmitted to external servers
- **You control what's stored** - Only information you explicitly ask to remember
- **Easy to delete** - Simple commands to remove any or all memories
- **Transparent storage** - You can view exactly what's stored

## üë§ User Profile & Personalization

Jarvis can learn about you to provide personalized responses and remember your preferences.

### Setting Up Your Profile

#### **Your Name**
```
"My name is Sarah"                   ‚Üí Sets your name
"Call me Mike"                       ‚Üí Sets preferred name
"I'm Jennifer, but call me Jen"      ‚Üí Sets both full and preferred name
```

#### **Pronouns**
```
"My pronouns are she/her"
"Use he/him pronouns for me"
"I use they/them pronouns"
```

#### **Preferences**
```
"Remember that I prefer to be called by my first name"
"Remember I like formal responses"
"Remember I prefer brief answers"
```

### Managing Your Profile

#### **Viewing Profile Information**
```
"Show my profile"                    ‚Üí Displays all profile information
"What's my name?"                    ‚Üí Shows your name
"What do you know about me?"         ‚Üí Shows profile summary
```

#### **Privacy Controls**
```
"Allow Jarvis to use my name"        ‚Üí Enables name usage
"Don't use my name in responses"     ‚Üí Disables name usage
"Clear my profile"                   ‚Üí Removes all profile information
```

### How Personalization Works

Once you've set up your profile, Jarvis will:

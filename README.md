## 🎯 Why Jarvis's Architecture Matters

### **Extensibility Without Disruption**
- **Add new functionality** without modifying core code
- **Create custom UIs** that run independently
- **Integrate external services** through isolated MCP servers
- **Develop plugins** without understanding the entire system

### **Stability Through Isolation**
- **Plugin crashes** don't affect core system or other plugins
- **UI failures** don't impact voice functionality
- **External service outages** only affect specific integrations
- **Core updates** don't break existing extensions

### **Developer-Friendly Design**
- **Simple plugin creation** with Python decorators
- **Independent UI development** using any web framework
- **Clean APIs** with well-defined boundaries
- **Rapid iteration** without system-wide impacts

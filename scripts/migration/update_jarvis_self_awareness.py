This file is part of the major wake word detection fix and smart routing implementation that resolved:
- Wake word detection reliability issues
- 46+ second response time problems  
- Smart routing between tools and LLM knowledge
- Simplified architecture for better stability

MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

‚úÖ WAKE WORD DETECTION FIXED:
- Issue: Complex async/threading architecture was preventing wake word detection
- Solution: Implemented simplified synchronous architecture based on working patterns
- Result: Reliable "jarvis" wake word activation with proper conversation mode
- Startup: Use "python start_jarvis_fixed.py" for working version

‚úÖ SMART RESPONSE ROUTING IMPLEMENTED:
- Issue: All queries taking 46+ seconds due to RAG system overhead
- Solution: Intelligent routing between tools and LLM knowledge
- Results:
  * ‚ö° Time queries: Instant response (direct tool call)
  * üß† General knowledge: Fast LLM responses (bypass tools)
  * üõ†Ô∏è Specific actions: Appropriate tool usage

‚úÖ PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Time queries now instant instead of 46+ seconds
- General knowledge questions get fast, comprehensive answers
- Proper tool selection only for specific actions
- Maintained all 34 tools while improving response times

‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE CHANGES:
- Created start_jarvis_fixed.py with proven working architecture
- Smart query routing determines when to use tools vs. LLM knowledge
- Direct LLM access for general knowledge (bypasses RAG hijacking)
- Simplified synchronous main loop (no async/threading issues)

‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:
- Added CURRENT_STATUS.md with complete system state
- Added QUICK_START_CURRENT.md with working startup method
- Updated README.md with current working features
- Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with resolved issues

CURRENT STATUS: Jarvis is now fully functional with reliable wake word detection and intelligent response routing.

STARTUP COMMAND: python start_jarvis_fixed.py

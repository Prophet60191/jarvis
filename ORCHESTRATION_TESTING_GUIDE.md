# 🧪 Jarvis Orchestration Testing Guide

**Purpose**: Test the enhanced orchestration system with real user prompts to validate orchestration detection, tool selection, and learning capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Run Comprehensive Testing**
Tests multiple categories of prompts to validate orchestration across different complexity levels:

```bash
cd "/Users/josed/Desktop/Voice App"
python run_orchestration_tests.py comprehensive
```

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Simple direct knowledge questions
- ✅ Single tool usage (time, memory, RAG)
- ✅ Medium complexity (website extraction, code development, research)
- ✅ Complex multi-agent workflows
- ✅ Learning and adaptation scenarios

### **2. Run Learning Session**
Progressive learning with feedback to improve orchestration over time:

```bash
python run_orchestration_tests.py learning
```

**What it does**:
- 🧠 Starts with simple prompts to establish baseline
- 🎯 Progresses to medium complexity orchestration
- 🚀 Tests complex multi-agent workflows
- 📊 Provides feedback to learning system
- 📈 Tracks improvement across phases

### **3. Test Single Prompt**
Test a specific prompt to see orchestration behavior:

```bash
python run_orchestration_tests.py single --prompt "Extract data from a website and create a summary"
```

**Options**:
- `--verbose`: Show detailed analysis
- `--prompt`: The prompt to test

## 📊 What to Look For

### **✅ Good Orchestration Responses**

#### **Website Extraction Example**:
```
I'll handle this website data extraction for you. Here's my plan:
1. First, I'll use LaVague to explore the site structure and identify data patterns
2. Then, I'll coordinate with Aider to create a custom scraper based on the analysis
3. Finally, I'll use Open Interpreter to execute the scraper and process the data

Let me start by analyzing the website structure...
```

#### **Code Development Example**:
```
I'll build a comprehensive monitoring system for you. Here's my plan:
1. First, I'll check my knowledge base for existing monitoring patterns
2. Then, I'll use Aider to create the monitoring script with alerting capabilities
3. Next, I'll test the script with Open Interpreter to validate functionality
4. Finally, I'll create automated tests to ensure reliability

Let me start by checking for existing monitoring patterns...
```

### **🎯 Orchestration Indicators to Watch For**

#### **Planning Language**:
- "Here's my plan"
- "I'll handle this [task type] for you"
- "Let me break this down"

#### **Coordination Language**:
- "First, I'll use [Agent A] to [action]"
- "Then, I'll coordinate with [Agent B] to [action]"
- "Finally, I'll [synthesis action]"

#### **Tool Awareness**:
- Mentions specific agents: "Aider", "LaVague", "Open Interpreter", "RAG"
- Understands tool capabilities
- Plans appropriate tool sequences

#### **Professional Communication**:
- Confident tone ("I'll coordinate this workflow")
- Clear explanations of what will happen
- Step-by-step breakdown of complex tasks

## 🧪 Test Categories Explained

### **Simple Direct Knowledge**
**Expected**: No orchestration needed, direct LLM response
```
"What is the capital of France?"
"Explain how photosynthesis works"
```

### **Simple Single Tool**
**Expected**: Single tool usage, basic coordination
```
"What time is it?" → get_current_time
"Remember my Python preference" → remember_fact
```

### **Medium Website Extraction**
**Expected**: LaVague → Aider → Open Interpreter orchestration
```
"Extract product information from https://example-store.com"
"Scrape news headlines from a tech website"
```

### **Medium Code Development**
**Expected**: Aider → Open Interpreter coordination
```
"Create a Python script that monitors CPU usage"
"Build a web scraper for stock prices"
```

### **Medium Research Analysis**
**Expected**: RAG → LaVague → Analysis coordination
```
"Analyze current trends in renewable energy"
"Research latest AI developments"
```

### **Complex Multi-Agent**
**Expected**: Full orchestration with 3+ agents
```
"Extract data from website, analyze it, and create a dashboard"
"Build a monitoring system, test it, and create documentation"
```

## 📈 Understanding Test Results

### **Success Metrics**

#### **Orchestration Detection Rate**
- **90%+**: Excellent - system reliably detects when orchestration is needed
- **70-89%**: Good - mostly working with some missed opportunities
- **<70%**: Needs improvement - orchestration not being triggered enough

#### **Complexity Matching**
- **High**: Response complexity matches prompt complexity
- **Medium**: Some mismatch but generally appropriate
- **Low**: Significant mismatch - simple responses to complex prompts

#### **Tool Selection Accuracy**
- **Correct**: Mentions appropriate tools for the task
- **Partial**: Some correct tools mentioned
- **Incorrect**: Wrong tools or no specific tools mentioned

### **Quality Indicators**

#### **Professional Communication**
- Clear workflow explanations
- Confident, intelligent tone
- Step-by-step planning

#### **Technical Accuracy**
- Appropriate tool selection
- Logical workflow sequences
- Understanding of tool capabilities

#### **User Experience**
- Helpful and informative responses
- Clear expectations set
- Professional presentation

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Orchestration Isn't Detected**

1. **Check Integration**: Ensure orchestration system is initialized
2. **Verify Prompts**: Use prompts that clearly need multiple tools
3. **Check Keywords**: System looks for specific orchestration triggers
4. **Review Logs**: Check for initialization or execution errors

### **If Responses Are Generic**

1. **Prompt Complexity**: Try more complex, multi-step requests
2. **Tool Keywords**: Include words like "extract", "build", "create", "analyze"
3. **Specific Requests**: Be specific about what you want accomplished

### **If Tests Fail**

1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure Jarvis is properly installed
2. **Verify Paths**: Make sure Python can find the jarvis package
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure write permissions for result files
4. **Review Errors**: Check error messages for specific issues

## 📊 Expected Learning Progression

### **Phase 1: Baseline (Simple Prompts)**
- Should handle basic tool usage correctly
- No orchestration needed for simple requests
- Establishes baseline performance

### **Phase 2: Orchestration (Medium Complexity)**
- Should start showing orchestration behavior
- Clear workflow planning and tool coordination
- Professional communication style

### **Phase 3: Complex Workflows (Advanced)**
- Full orchestration with multiple agents
- Sophisticated workflow planning
- Adaptive behavior based on learning

## 💡 Tips for Effective Testing

### **Prompt Design**
- **Be specific**: "Extract product data from website X" vs "help with website"
- **Multi-step**: Include tasks that clearly need multiple tools
- **Realistic**: Use real-world scenarios you'd actually want Jarvis to handle

### **Learning Feedback**
- Run learning sessions regularly to improve performance
- Test the same prompts over time to see improvement
- Provide feedback on orchestration quality

### **Analysis**
- Look for improvement trends across test sessions
- Compare orchestration detection rates over time
- Monitor response quality and user experience

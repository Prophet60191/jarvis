## **üéØ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES**

### **User Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Understanding Features**
```
User: "Hey Jarvis, how does your analytics dashboard work?"
Jarvis: "The analytics dashboard is implemented in jarvis/jarvis/ui/analytics_dashboard.py. It provides real-time monitoring of system performance, usage analytics, and user behavior insights. The dashboard uses PyQt6 for the interface and tracks metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, tool usage patterns, and response times..."
```

#### **Scenario 2: Configuration Help**
```
User: "Hey Jarvis, what voice commands can I use?"
Jarvis: "I have comprehensive voice command support documented in VOICE_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md. The main categories include system control commands like 'open settings', plugin-specific commands for tools like Aider and LaVague, memory commands like 'remember that', and help commands like 'open user help'..."
```

#### **Scenario 3: Technical Troubleshooting**
```
User: "Hey Jarvis, how do I optimize your performance?"
Jarvis: "Performance optimization is handled through several systems. The performance monitoring in jarvis/jarvis/core/monitoring/ tracks response times and resource usage. You can optimize through the analytics dashboard settings, enable caching in the configuration, and use the performance optimization guide..."
```

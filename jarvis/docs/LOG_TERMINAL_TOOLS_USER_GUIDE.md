# üìä Log Terminal Tools User Guide

Complete guide for using Log Terminal Tools with Jarvis Voice Assistant for debugging and system monitoring.

## üéØ What are Log Terminal Tools?

Log Terminal Tools provide voice-controlled access to Jarvis's debug logs and system information through dedicated terminal windows. This allows you to monitor Jarvis's operation, debug issues, and view real-time system information without interrupting your main workflow.

### **Key Features**
- **Real-time log viewing**: See Jarvis logs as they happen
- **Voice-controlled terminals**: Open and close log windows with voice commands
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Debug information**: Access detailed system and application information
- **Non-intrusive monitoring**: Logs display in separate windows

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Requirements

### **System Requirements**

**macOS**:
- Terminal.app (built-in)
- No additional setup required

**Linux**:
- Any terminal emulator (gnome-terminal, xterm, konsole, etc.)
- X11 or Wayland display server

**Windows**:
- Windows Terminal (recommended)
- PowerShell or Command Prompt
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (optional)

### **Verification**

Check if Log Terminal Tools are available:

```
"Show log status"
```

You should see confirmation that terminal tools are ready.

## üé§ Voice Commands

## üîß How It Works

### **1. Voice Command Processing**
1. You request to open debug logs
2. Jarvis identifies the appropriate terminal application
3. A new terminal window is launched

### **2. Log Streaming**
1. Terminal connects to Jarvis's log system
2. Real-time logs are streamed to the terminal
3. Logs are formatted for easy reading
4. Different log levels are color-coded (if supported)

### **3. Terminal Management**
1. Terminal windows are tracked by Jarvis
2. Multiple terminals can be open simultaneously
3. Closing commands properly terminate terminals
4. System resources are cleaned up automatically

## üìù Usage Examples

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### **System Health Monitoring**

Use log terminals to monitor:

**Performance Issues**:
- Slow response times
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization spikes

**Plugin Problems**:
- Loading failures
- Runtime errors
- Configuration issues

**Voice Recognition Issues**:
- Microphone problems
- Wake word detection
- Command processing errors

### **Troubleshooting Workflow**

1. **Open debug logs**: `"Open debug logs"`
2. **Reproduce the issue**: Perform the problematic action
3. **Observe log output**: Look for errors or warnings
4. **Identify the problem**: Find the root cause in logs
5. **Close logs when done**: `"Close debug logs"`

### **Common Log Patterns**

**Successful Operation**:
```
[INFO] Command received: "what time is it"
[DEBUG] Routing to device_time_tool
[DEBUG] Executing get_current_time()
[INFO] Response: "It's 2:30 PM"
```

**Plugin Error**:
```
[ERROR] Plugin loading failed: missing_plugin.py
[DEBUG] ImportError: No module named 'missing_dependency'
[WARNING] Plugin disabled: missing_plugin
```

**Memory System Activity**:
```
[DEBUG] RAG search query: "user preferences"
[DEBUG] ChromaDB query executed
[INFO] Found 2 relevant memories
[DEBUG] Returning formatted results
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Effective Log Monitoring**

**‚úÖ Good Practices**:
- Open logs before reproducing issues
- Keep log windows visible during debugging
- Close logs when not needed to save resources
- Use specific log filtering for focused debugging

**‚ùå Avoid**:
- Leaving multiple log terminals open unnecessarily
- Ignoring error messages in logs
- Closing logs too quickly when debugging

### **Performance Considerations**

1. **Resource Usage**: Log terminals consume system resources
2. **Log Rotation**: Old logs are automatically managed
3. **Filtering**: Use filters to reduce log volume
4. **Cleanup**: Close terminals when debugging is complete

### **Security Notes**

1. **Sensitive Information**: Logs may contain user data
2. **API Keys**: Credentials are masked in logs
3. **Privacy**: Personal information is filtered when possible
4. **Local Storage**: All logs remain on your local machine

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### **Multiple Terminal Windows**

You can open multiple log terminals for different purposes:

```
"Open debug logs"           # General debugging
"Open error logs only"      # Error monitoring
"Show plugin logs"          # Plugin-specific issues
```

### **Log Analysis**

Use terminal features for log analysis:

**Search in Logs**:
- Use Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on macOS) to search
- Look for specific error messages
- Find patterns in log output

**Copy Log Information**:
- Select and copy relevant log entries
- Share error messages for support
- Save important debugging information

### **Integration with Development**

**For Plugin Development**:
- Monitor plugin loading and execution
- Debug custom tool implementations
- Test error handling and edge cases

**For System Administration**:
- Monitor system health and performance
- Track resource usage patterns
- Identify configuration issues

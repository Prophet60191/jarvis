# 🎯 Jarvis Voice Assistant - Current Status

**Last Updated**: July 29, 2025  
**Version**: 4.0.0+  
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

## 🎉 Major Issues Resolved

### ✅ Wake Word Detection - FIXED
- **Issue**: Complex async/threading architecture was preventing wake word detection
- **Solution**: Implemented simplified synchronous architecture based on working patterns
- **Status**: **FULLY WORKING** - Jarvis reliably responds to "jarvis" wake word
- **Performance**: Instant wake word detection with proper conversation mode activation

### ✅ Smart Response Routing - IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: All queries were being processed by slow RAG system (46+ seconds)
- **Solution**: Intelligent routing between tools and LLM knowledge
- **Status**: **FULLY WORKING** - Fast responses for appropriate query types
- **Performance**: 
  - Time queries: **Instant** (⚡ Quick time response)
  - General knowledge: **Fast** (🧠 LLM knowledge)
  - Specific actions: **Appropriate** (🛠️ Tools)

## 🚀 Current Architecture

### **Simplified Main Loop**
```
Wake Word Detection → Conversation Mode → Smart Query Routing
```

**No complex async/threading** - Uses proven synchronous architecture that works reliably.

### **Smart Query Routing**
1. **⚡ Quick Responses**: Time queries, simple actions
2. **🧠 LLM Knowledge**: General knowledge questions (cars, science, history)
3. **🛠️ Tool Processing**: Specific actions (open settings, search memory)

### **Audio System**
- **Speech Recognition**: Whisper (local, offline)
- **Text-to-Speech**: Coqui TTS with vctk_p374 voice
- **Microphone**: MacBook Pro Microphone (index 2) with optimized settings
- **Wake Word**: "jarvis" with confidence-based detection

## 🔧 Technical Configuration

### **Working Settings**
```bash
# Environment Variables (Applied)
JARVIS_MIC_INDEX=2
JARVIS_MIC_NAME="MacBook Pro Microphone"
JARVIS_ENERGY_THRESHOLD=100
```

### **Startup Command**
```bash
cd "/Users/josed/Desktop/Voice App"
python start_jarvis_fixed.py
```

**Note**: Use `start_jarvis_fixed.py` instead of the complex `jarvis.main` for reliable operation.

- **RAG Plugin**: Still available but bypassed for general knowledge

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### **Starting Jarvis**
```bash
cd "/Users/josed/Desktop/Voice App"
python start_jarvis_fixed.py
```

### **Basic Usage**
1. **Activation**: Say "jarvis" (wait for "Yes sir?" response)
2. **Commands**: Speak your request
3. **Examples**:
   - "What time is it?" → Instant time
   - "Tell me about cars" → General knowledge
   - "Open settings" → Tool action

### **Conversation Flow**
```
User: "jarvis"
Jarvis: "Yes sir?"
User: "What time is it?"
Jarvis: "The current time is 6:47 PM"
User: "Tell me about cars"
Jarvis: [Comprehensive car information]
```

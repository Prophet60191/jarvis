## Advanced Usage

### Custom Benchmarks

Create custom benchmark tests:

```python
from benchmark_system import BenchmarkTest

# Define custom test
custom_test = BenchmarkTest(
    name="custom_operation",
    query="Your custom query here",
    expected_tool="expected_tool_name",
    timeout_seconds=10.0,
    category="custom",
    complexity="medium"
)

# Run custom test
result = await benchmark.run_single_test(custom_test)
```

### Performance Analysis

```python
# Get detailed performance statistics
from jarvis.core.routing import SmartConversationManager

manager = SmartConversationManager()
stats = manager.get_performance_stats()

print(f"Fast path usage: {stats['fast_path_usage']}")
print(f"Average response time: {stats['avg_response_time']}")
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']}")
```

### Continuous Integration

Integrate benchmarks into CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# Run benchmarks with CI-friendly output
python run_benchmarks.py --ci --json-output --threshold 90

# Exit codes:
# 0: All benchmarks passed
# 1: Some benchmarks failed
# 2: Critical performance regression detected
```

## Configuration

### Benchmark Settings

```python
# benchmark_config.py
BENCHMARK_CONFIG = {
    "timeout_multiplier": 1.5,  # Allow 50% longer than target
    "retry_failed_tests": True,
    "detailed_logging": True,
    "save_results": True,
    "results_directory": "benchmark_results",
    "performance_threshold": 0.9  # 90% success rate required
}
```

### Performance Thresholds

```python
# Performance regression detection
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "simple_queries": 0.5,      # 500ms max for simple queries
    "complex_queries": 45.0,    # 45s max for complex queries
    "success_rate_min": 0.85,   # 85% minimum success rate
    "regression_threshold": 2.0  # 2x slowdown triggers alert
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Benchmark Timeouts**
   ```bash
   # Increase timeout multiplier
   export BENCHMARK_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=2.0
   python run_benchmarks.py
   ```

2. **Performance Regression**
   ```bash
   # Run detailed analysis
   python run_benchmarks.py --analysis --detailed
   ```

3. **Tool Integration Failures**
   ```bash
   # Test individual tools
   python run_benchmarks.py --suite tool_integration --verbose
   ```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export JARVIS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python run_benchmarks.py --debug
```

## Interpreting Results

### Performance Ratings

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXCELLENT**: >95% success, all targets met
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **GOOD**: 85-95% success, most targets met
- ⭐⭐⭐ **FAIR**: 70-85% success, some optimization needed
- ⭐⭐ **POOR**: 50-70% success, significant issues

### Optimization Recommendations

The system provides specific optimization recommendations:

```
🎯 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Consider enabling response caching for repeated queries
• Tool selection could be optimized for memory operations
• Complex workflow timeout threshold may need adjustment
• Fast path patterns could be expanded for better coverage
```

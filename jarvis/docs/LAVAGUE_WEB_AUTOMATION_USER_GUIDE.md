# üåê LaVague Web Automation User Guide

Complete guide for using LaVague AI-powered web automation with Jarvis Voice Assistant.

## üéØ What is LaVague Web Automation?

LaVague Web Automation enables you to control websites using natural language voice commands. Instead of manually clicking buttons and filling forms, you can simply tell Jarvis what you want to do on a website, and LaVague will perform those actions automatically.

### **Key Capabilities**
- **Natural language web control**: Describe what you want to do in plain English
- **Intelligent web navigation**: AI understands web page structure and content
- **Form filling**: Automatically fill out forms with specified information
- **Data extraction**: Scrape information from websites
- **Cross-site automation**: Work with any website without custom scripts

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### **1. Install LaVague**

```bash
# Install LaVague core and Selenium driver
pip install lavague-core lavague-drivers-selenium

# Install additional dependencies
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
```

### **2. Browser Setup**

LaVague uses Chrome/Chromium browser:

```bash
# Chrome will be automatically detected
# Or install Chromium if needed:
# macOS: brew install chromium

```

### **3. Verify Setup**

Use Jarvis to check if LaVague is properly configured:

```
"Check LaVague status"
```

You should see confirmation that LaVague is installed and ready.

## üîß How It Works

### **1. Voice Command Processing**
1. You give a voice command describing the web task
2. Jarvis recognizes it as a web automation request
3. LaVague receives the natural language instruction

### **2. AI Web Understanding**
1. LaVague opens the specified website
2. AI analyzes the page structure and content
3. Identifies the relevant elements (buttons, forms, links)
4. Plans the sequence of actions needed

### **3. Automated Execution**
1. LaVague performs the actions (clicking, typing, scrolling)
2. Handles dynamic content and page changes
3. Extracts requested information if needed
4. Reports results back to Jarvis

## üìù Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Online Shopping**

**Voice Command**: "Go to Amazon and search for wireless keyboards under $50"

**What Happens**:
1. Opens Amazon.com
2. Finds and clicks the search box
3. Types "wireless keyboards"
4. Applies price filter for under $50
5. Shows you the results

### **Example 2: Form Submission**

**Voice Command**: "Fill out the contact form on example.com with name John Doe, email john@example.com, and message 'Interested in your services'"

**What Happens**:
1. Navigates to example.com
2. Locates the contact form
3. Fills in the name field with "John Doe"
4. Enters the email address
5. Types the message in the message field
6. Submits the form

### **Example 3: Data Extraction**

**Voice Command**: "Extract the business hours and phone number from this restaurant website"

**What Happens**:

- Browser runs in background without visible window
- Faster execution
- Less resource intensive

**Visible Mode** (for debugging):
```
"Navigate to google.com with visible browser"
```

### **Timeout Settings**

LaVague automatically handles page loading and element waiting, but you can specify timeouts:

```
"Wait for the page to fully load before extracting data"
"Give the form 30 seconds to submit"
```

### **Data Format Options**

When extracting data, you can specify the format:

```
"Extract the product information as a list"
"Get the contact details in JSON format"

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Effective Voice Commands**

**‚úÖ Good Commands**:
- "Fill out the login form with username 'john' and password 'secret'"
- "Extract all product prices from this page"
- "Click the blue 'Submit' button at the bottom"

**‚ùå Avoid Vague Commands**:
- "Do something on this website"
- "Click that thing"
- "Get the information"

### **Website Compatibility**

**Works Best With**:
- Standard HTML forms and buttons
- Common e-commerce sites
- News and information websites
- Social media platforms

**May Have Issues With**:
- Heavy JavaScript applications
- Sites with complex authentication
- Pages with unusual layouts
- Sites that block automation

### **Safety and Ethics**

1. **Respect robots.txt**: Don't automate sites that prohibit it
2. **Rate limiting**: Don't overwhelm servers with rapid requests
3. **Terms of service**: Ensure automation is allowed
4. **Personal data**: Be careful with sensitive information
5. **Testing**: Use test sites for learning and development

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### **Multi-Step Workflows**

```
"Go to LinkedIn, search for software engineers in San Francisco, 
 and save the first 10 profiles to a list"
```

### **Conditional Actions**

```
"If the product is in stock, add it to cart, otherwise notify me"
"Check if there are any new messages and read them to me"
```

### **Cross-Site Comparisons**

```

```

### **Scheduled Automation**

```
"Check this website every hour for new job postings"
"Monitor this product page for price changes"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

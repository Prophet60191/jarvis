# Full-Stack Application Development Workflow Guide

## Project Tracking
- Create a project tracking document at the start of development
- Track for each phase:
  - Current status (Not Started/In Progress/Complete)
  - Dependencies and requirements
  - Decisions made and rationale
  - Code components created
  - Issues encountered and solutions
  - Testing results
  - Performance metrics
- Update tracking document after each significant change
- Use tracking for:
  - Progress monitoring
  - Decision history
  - Knowledge transfer
  - Issue tracking
  - Quality assurance

## 1. Research Phase
- Search for latest best practices and common pitfalls for the chosen tech stack
- Research security considerations and compliance requirements
- Gather information about scalability patterns and performance optimization
- Look for recent developer experiences and solutions to common problems
- Document findings in a structured format for reference

## 2. Project Initialization
- Document initial project setup in tracking document:
  - Selected tech stack and rationale
  - Project structure decisions
  - Development environment setup
  - Initial configuration choices
- Choose appropriate tech stack based on requirements:
  - Frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular)
  - Backend technology (Node.js, Python, Java)
  - Database solution (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
  - Testing frameworks (Jest, PyTest, JUnit)
- Set up project structure:
  - Create directory hierarchy
  - Initialize version control
  - Set up dependency management
  - Configure development environment

## 3. Frontend Development
- Track in project document:
  - Component hierarchy
  - State management approach
  - UI/UX decisions
  - Third-party integrations
- Set up frontend framework and tools
- Create component structure:
  - Layout components
  - Shared/common components
  - Page-specific components
- Implement routing and navigation
- Set up state management
- Design and implement UI/UX
- Add responsive design and accessibility features

## 4. Backend Development
- Document in tracking system:
  - API endpoints and their status
  - Middleware configurations
  - Security measures implemented
  - Service architecture decisions
- Set up server framework and middleware
- Design and implement API endpoints:
  - Authentication routes
  - Resource routes
  - Utility endpoints
- Add security measures:
  - Input validation
  - Request sanitization
  - Rate limiting
  - CORS configuration
- Implement error handling and logging

## 5. Database Integration
- Track in project document:
  - Database schema versions
  - Data relationships
  - Migration history
  - Performance optimizations
- Set up database connection and configuration
- Design database schema
- Create data models
- Implement data access layer
- Set up migrations system
- Add data validation and sanitization
- Implement caching strategy

## 6. Testing
- Document in tracking system:
  - Test coverage metrics
  - Failed test cases and fixes
  - Performance test results
  - Security audit findings
- Write unit tests for:
  - Frontend components
  - Backend services
  - Database operations
- Create integration tests
- Set up end-to-end testing
- Implement performance testing
- Add security testing
- Set up continuous integration

## 7. Deployment
- Update tracking document with:
  - Deployment configurations
  - Environment variables
  - Access credentials (securely)
  - Monitoring setup
- Choose deployment platform
- Configure deployment settings:
  - Environment variables
  - Build scripts
  - Server configurations
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure domain and DNS
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Set up backup systems
- Create deployment documentation

## Best Practices Throughout Development
1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Maintain clear file structure
   - Use appropriate design patterns
   - Write clear documentation

2. **Version Control**
   - Make regular commits
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Follow branching strategy
   - Review code changes

3. **Security**
   - Follow security best practices
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Implement authentication/authorization
   - Protect sensitive data

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize code and assets
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Follow loading best practices

5. **Maintenance**
   - Write maintainable code
   - Document technical decisions
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor for issues

## Error Handling and Recovery
- Implement proper error handling at each phase
- Create recovery procedures for common issues
- Document troubleshooting steps
- Set up monitoring and alerting

## Documentation
- Ensure tracking document is finalized with:
  - Complete project history
  - All technical decisions
  - Known issues and solutions
  - Future improvement recommendations
- Maintain technical documentation
- Create API documentation
- Write deployment guides
- Include maintenance procedures
- Document configuration details

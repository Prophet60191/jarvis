server health that checks every 5 minutes, logs issues, and 
sends email alerts. Build this as a Python script with a 
configuration file."
```

## 🎯 Quick Success Check

**Your prompt is GOOD if Jarvis responds with:**
- ✅ "Here's my plan:"
- ✅ "I'll handle this [complexity] task"
- ✅ Mentions specific agents (Aider, LaVague, etc.)
- ✅ Step-by-step workflow explanation

**Your prompt needs IMPROVEMENT if Jarvis:**
- ❌ Gives generic advice
- ❌ No "Here's my plan" format
- ❌ Doesn't mention specific tools
- ❌ Response doesn't match complexity
